# dragonrealms-dobby

Dobby is a Java-based scripting proxy for [DragonRealms](https://www.play.net/dr/). The idea is that it works with, rather than replacing your client. You probably heard of the [Lich Project](https://lichproject.org), this does something like that.

## Why the name?

Dobby was the house elf in Harry Potter who helped the Malfoy family with chores. This proxy is supposed to do a similar function, help you.

## How do I run it?

1. Add the following to your /etc/hosts file:

$ sudo vi /etc/hosts

```
127.0.0.1   dr.simutronics.net
```

2. Run a proxy for the DR game server.

$ java -jar dobby-<version>.jar 4901 199.188.208.5 4901

## How do I use it?

Well, right now you don't... but maybe someday soon.
